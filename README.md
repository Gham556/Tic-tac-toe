# Tic-tac-toe

The goal of this project was to create a working Tic-Tac-Toe game. 

Setting up the board and player inputs were easy. 

I ran into a preblem when it came to deciding a game winner because I had no reliable way to store the quares being pressed. This was fixed by changing the value of 'this' within the game board array I created to either a 0 or when. 

I then created new objects for the winning pairings and added the values together to check for a winner. The same concept applies to deciding ties. 

In the future I may come back and create an AI that the player can play against.
